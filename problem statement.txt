Task Name : CAT API 
-----------------


Implement the Cat API using async/await with fetch.



Constraints:
-----------
1.All your HTML elements should be created with DOM.

2.Use the async/await.

3.Use try catch to handle errors.

4.Use fetch() to get the data from Cats Api

5.All JavaScript codes should be in a script file named script.js which has to be imported in your HTML page.



How do I process the API data?
------------------------------

1.List all the cats on the screen with a given api https://cataas.com/api/cats.

2.Place a search bar on the top of your webpage and filter cats based on the searched keyword using this api https://cataas.com/api/cats?tags=cute.

3.Display the cat image in a popup on your webpage.

4.To get the image url, append the cat id with the url. 

Example: https://cataas.com/cat/<CAT_ID>
